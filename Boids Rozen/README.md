## Description
**Sheepy** is a 2D herding game where you play as a dog tasked with herding sheep back into a pen before time runs out.

Created as part of a course on AI for video games, **Sheepy** showcases boid algorithms. Every aspect of the game, from the scripts to the visual assets, was developed by me, with the exception of the royalty-free music.
